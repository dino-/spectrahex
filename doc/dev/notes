Distribution for different difficulty levels:


board size: 36

total pri's 36        45       60

primary     36 100%   27 75%   16 43.75%

secondary    X         9 25%   16 43.75%

tertiary     X         X        4 12.5%

difficulty   N        D        I


So, this means:

A Normal game will have 36 randomly selected primaries.
A Difficult game will have 27 randomly selected primaries and 9 randomly selected secondaries.
An Impossible game will have 16 randomly selected primaries, 16 randomly selected secondaries and 4 tertiaries (which can only be Gray. But are a bitch to get rid of)


board size: 45

total pri's 45        56       75

primary     45 100%   34 75%   20 43.75%

secondary    X        11 25%   20 43.75%

tertiary     X         X        5 12.5%

difficulty   N        D        I


So, this means:

A Normal game will have 45 randomly selected primaries.
A Difficult game will have 34 randomly selected primaries and 11 randomly selected secondaries.
An Impossible game will have 20 randomly selected primaries, 20 randomly selected secondaries and 5 tertiaries (which can only be Gray. But are a bitch to get rid of)

Permissions problem with connected device:

If you are having perms problems installing on a phone, and see this:

   $ adb devices

   ?????????????? No permissions

Do this:

   $ adb kill-server
   # adb start-server   (<-- notice AS ROOT!)
   $ adb devices   (<-- should look good now)
