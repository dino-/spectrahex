Distribution for different difficulty levels:

total pri's 45        56       75

primary     45 100%   34 75%   20 43.75%

secondary    X        11 25%   20 43.75%

tertiary     X         X        5 12.5%

difficulty   E        I        D


So, this means:

An Easy game will have 45 randomly selected primaries.
An Intermediate game will have 34 randomly selected primaries and 11 randomly selected secondaries.
A Difficult game will have 20 randomly selected primaries, 20 randomly selected secondaries and 5 tertiaries (which can only be Gray. But are a bitch to get rid of)
