- Found a strange bug on first-time run: save state not getting saved. But works on subsequent executions. Need logging.

- Change SpectraHex activity to GameActivity

- make the demo build, some kind of forked branch maybe?
   Demo means full functionality but only 12 games allowed.

- more elaborate About dialog
   Make email clickable

- more elaborate dashboard

- ability to install on the SD card (external storage)

- test in more emulators, specifically with different screens
