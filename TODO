   - Store the initial board state plus list of all moves. The board view applies all moved to the pristine board up to the head of the redo stack.

   - Store the current state of the board plus a list of pairs of states of 3 hexes like this:
      ((beforeOrigin, beforeSubtract, beforeAdd),
       (afterOrigin, afterSubtract, afterAdd))

- dashboard

- application icon

- device permissions, it can make phone calls? Why? Get rid of that

- change selection from white outline to a filled circle

- ability to install on the SD card (external storage)
