- Found a strange bug on first-time run: save state not getting saved. But works on subsequent executions. Need logging.

   Can't reproduce this at all 2010-08-28

   steps to reproduce:

      - uninstall application on device
      - install
      - run, make a move so you can recognize the board later
      - exit (make sure it's really unloaded?)
      - run again, board isn't loaded
      - repeat and it behaves normally?

- make the demo build, some kind of forked branch maybe?
   Demo means full functionality but only 12 games allowed.
   Or maybe full functionality but only 15 non-consecutive days.
   Google Market licensing doesn't seem to be capable of "demo first,
      pay later"

- more elaborate About dialog
   Make email clickable

- more elaborate dashboard

- ability to install on the SD card (external storage)

- test in more emulators, specifically with different screens
