<h1>SpectraHex</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>SpectraHex is a single player game in which the objective is to remove as many hexagonal tiles as you can from the game board, in as few moves as possible.</p>

<p>At the game start, you are presented with a full board of randomly placed colored tiles.</p>

<p>Moves consist of leaping a tile over an adjacent tile and onto a suitable space. Moves are performed to remove tiles from the board.</p>

<p>If you can remove all but a single primary-colored tile, you have done all you can do, and have solved that particular game.</p>

<p>During a game you may undo and redo moves that have been made. This is a normal part of game play and you are encouraged to backtrack to try different approaches.</p>


<h2>The board</h2>

<p>Hexes on the board may be empty, or filled with one, two or three tiles. The color of the hex shows you which tiles are present.</p>

<h3>Empty spaces</h3>

<p>Shown as a black hex. These count as zero tiles remaining:</p>

<h3>Primary tiles</h3>

<p>These are the three traditional subtractive primary colors, red, blue and yellow. They count as one tile remaining:</p>

<img src="tile-blue.png" alt="red tile" />
<img src="tile-yellow.png" alt="red tile" />

<h3>Secondary tiles</h3>

<p>These are combinations of two of the three primary colors. You will likely know these from painting or coloring. Orange, green and violet, they count as two tiles remaining:</p>

<img src="tile-green.png" alt="red tile" />
<img src="tile-violet.png" alt="red tile" />

<h3>Tertiary tiles</h3>

<p>Tertiary tiles are all three primaries combined. Shown as gray, they count as three tiles remaining:</p>

<h2>Game play</h2>

<h3>How to move</h3>

<p>Moving means a starting tile will leave its hex, jump over another tile (but NOT over an empty space) and arrive at the hex on the other side.</p>

<p>To start a move, select a tile by tapping on it. The board will highlight that tile with a white circle and will also highlight any legal destinations for it with black circles.</p>

<p>To complete the move, tap one of the destinations.</p>

<p>To cancel your move, tap the starting tile again (marked with a white circle) and it will be unselected, leaving the board unchanged.</p>

<h3>The moves</h3>

<p>Primary tiles remove ANY other primary tile when they leap over them:</p>

<p><img src="yellow-blue-empty.png" /></p>

<p>Colors subtract if possible when a tile leaps over another:</p>

<p><img src="blue-green-empty.png" /></p>
<p><img src="orange-orange-empty.png" /></p>
<p><img src="green-gray-empty.png" /></p>

<p>Colors add together if possible when they land on each other:</p>

<p><img src="yellow-yellow-yellow.png" /></p>
<p><img src="red-yellow-blue.png" /></p>
<p><img src="green-green-red.png" /></p>

<p>The tertiary tile can only leap over itself and can only land on itself or an empty hex. Because it's a combination of all three primary colors, it's difficult to work with:</p>

<h2>Difficulty levels</h2>

<h3>Normal</h3>

<p>Consists of 36 randomly placed primary tiles. 12 red, 12 blue and 12 yellow.</p>

<h3>Difficult</h3>

<p>9 each of red, blue and yellow, and 3 each of violet, green and orange. Making a total of 45 tiles.</p>

<h3>Impossible</h3>

<p>16 equally distributed primaries, 16 equally distributed secondaries, and 4 tertiaries. Making a total of 60 tiles. This is very tough!</p>


<h2>Tips</h2>

   <ul>
      <li>Try to get tiles away from the corners and edges</li>
      <li>Don't be afraid to use Undo/Redo. Trying different approaches is part of the fun.</li>
   </ul>
